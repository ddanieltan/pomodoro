# Pomodoro
Time tracking app using the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

Run [terminal.py](https://github.com/ddanieltan/pomodoro/blob/master/terminal.py) for a terminal-based Pomodoro timer.
* You can set your preferred number of minutes for Work and Rest. The recommended ratio is 25 minutes of **WORK** to 5 minutes of **REST**.
* Ensure that you limit non-work related distractions during your allocated **WORK** period.
* Ensure that you enjoy a break without work related interuptions during your **REST** period.
* A default alarm sound **shipbell.wav** is played at the end of any timed period. Please visit [soundbible.com/tags-alarm.html](soundbible.com/tags-alarm.html) for alternative alarms.
* A run consists of 1 **WORK** period followed by 1 **REST** period. Every run is captured in a log.
* You are suggested to take a long break of about 30 minutes after 4 runs.

[main.py](https://github.com/ddanieltan/pomodoro/blob/master/main.py) is a work in progress, where I am trying to create a GUI for this app using Tkinter.


This app was written in 4 Pomodoro runs.
